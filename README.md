## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster training)
  
## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser - 
2. Navigate to the **Upload & Predict** page.
3. Upload a clear image of the skin condition.
4. View the predicted disease, confidence score, and recommendations.

## Model Architecture

### Base Model
- **EfficientNetV2-B3**: Pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained weights for better performance and smaller model size

### Custom Layers
```
EfficientNetV2-B3 (base)
├── Global Average Pooling
├── Dropout (0.4)
├── Dense (512, ReLU) + BatchNorm
├── Dropout (0.3)
├── Dense (256, ReLU) + BatchNorm
├── Dropout (0.2)
└── Dense (23, Softmax)
```

### Training Strategy
- **Two-phase training**: Feature extraction + Fine-tuning
- **Data augmentation**: Rotation, shift, shear, zoom, flip
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpointing

## Performance

The model achieves high accuracy across multiple skin disease categories with:
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages ResNet50V2 pre-trained weights
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves generalization
- **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting
- **Fine-tuning**: Optimizes for specific disease detection

## Configuration

### Model Parameters
- **Image Size**: 300x300 pixels
- **Batch Size**: 32 (configurable)
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-3 (initial), 1e-4 (fine-tuning top half), 1e-5 (full fine-tuning)
- **Epochs**: 10 (initial training) + 15 (fine-tuning top half) + 15 (full fine-tuning)

### Data Augmentation
- **Rotation**: ±20 degrees
- **Width/Height Shift**: ±20%
- **Shear**: ±20%
- **Zoom**: ±20%
- **Horizontal Flip**: Enabled

## Important Notes

### Medical Disclaimer
- **This tool is for educational purposes only**
- **Not a replacement for professional medical advice**
- **Always consult healthcare professionals for diagnosis**
- **Results should be validated by medical experts**

### Limitations
- Accuracy depends on image quality and lighting
- Some rare conditions may not be accurately classified
- Model performance varies across different skin types
- Results are probabilistic and not definitive

### Best Practices
- Use clear, well-lit images
- Ensure good image resolution
- Include the affected area clearly
- Avoid shadows and reflections
- Use consistent lighting conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA/GPU Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Install CPU-only TensorFlow
   pip install tensorflow-cpu
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Reduce batch size in `skin_disease_model.py`
   - Use smaller image size
   - Close other applications

3. **Model Not Found**:
   - Ensure you've trained the model first
   - Check file path in `app.py`

4. **Dataset Issues**:
   - Verify folder structure matches expected format
   - Ensure all categories have images
   - Check file permissions

## Future Enhancements
   - Mobile application development
   - Real-time video analysis
   - Integration with electronic health records
   - Additional disease categories
   - Multi-language support
   - API development for third-party integration
